# My Python Scripts

## Introduction  
Welcome to my Python repository! This is where I showcase my journey in programming with Python, from beginner exercises to more advanced concepts. Each script reflects what I’ve learned from various courses and projects. Whether you’re a fellow learner or an experienced developer, I hope you find these scripts insightful.

## Repository Structure  
- **Udemy Course:** A collection of exercises and projects inspired by the Python course I took on Udemy.  
- **Guanabara Exercises:** Programs written following the lessons from Gustavo Guanabara's Python tutorials.  
- **Configurations:** Useful settings for tools like VS Code to streamline development.

## Highlights  
- Practice scripts covering randomization, loops, and file manipulation.  
- Real-world examples designed to reinforce programming fundamentals.  
- Modular and reusable code snippets for quick implementation.

## Future Plans  
I plan to keep adding new projects as I learn more. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to explore!
